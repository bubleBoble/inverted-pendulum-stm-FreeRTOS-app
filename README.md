# About
This is apppliation for stm32f4 with freeRTOS+CLI for control of linear inverted pendulum (abbr. LIP). Control system is based on full state feedback with DC motor voltage deadzone compensation.

Control system is based on full state feedback with DC motor voltage deadzone compensation. Control scope includes stabilization of pendulum arm in up position, oscillation damping in arm down position and swingup. Swingup works in open-loop, the trajectory of input voltage was calculated by method of dynamic system trajectory optimization.

Some low-pass filters are implemented for numerical derivatives, by discretizing $\mathrm{G}(\mathrm{s})=\frac{1}{\mathrm{T}\mathrm{s}+1}$  transfer function. Project includes basic implementation of some FIR and IIR filters which were not used in the final control functionality.

App has its own CLI (*Command line interface*) based on FreeRTOS CLI command interpreter ported to work with stm32f4. CLI works over the same uart as the debugger so that there is no need to connect another USB cable to the board.

In the beginning the project base code was autogenerated using STM32 CubeMX and it's located under Core/ directory. LIP App is separated from autogenerated code and is located under LIP/ directory. Later project was moved from cubeIDE enviroment into CMake and Makefile. CMake based build can be started by using *makefile* in the project root location. It more or less acts as a wrapper for cmake commands, this makefile is based on [github/prtzl/stm32](https://github.com/prtzl/stm32/tree/master) base project.

# Notes

## Note 1:
From FreeRTOS/portable leave:
```
    portable/GCC/ARM_CM4F
    portable/GCC/MemMang/heap4.c is fine
```
rest of porable code has to be excluded from the build

## Note 2:
`FreeRTOSConfig.h` is located in LIP/include/FreeRTOSConfig.h

## Adding freeRTOS to stm32CubeIDE
1. Add src files to the build
   - FreeRTOS/Source/*.c

2. Add include paths
   - FreeRTOS/Source/include
   - FreeRTOS/Source/portable/GCC/ARM_CM4
     (remember about FreeRTOSConfig.h)

3. In cubemx / System Core / NVIC / code generation tab:
   - disable "generate IRQ handler" for "System service call via SWI instruction"
   - disable "generate IRQ handler" for "Pendable request for system service"


## Dev board used

## GPIOs for motor pwm (TIM3)
    PA6 for CH1 (alias pwm1_dcmA1)
    PA7 for CH2 (alias pwm2_dcmA2)


    Timer for PWM motor control is tim3 (htim3)
    (APB1@84MHz) on CH1 & CH2
    PSC set to 83 (84)
    ARR set to 999 (1000)
    Auto-reload preload: enabled
    Counter mode: up
    Pwm freq = 1kHz

## Add float formatting support for sprintf
In newlib-nano the float formatting support is not enabled by default, 
check your MCU Settings from "Project Properties > C/C++ Build > Settings > Tool Settings", 
or add manually `-u _printf_float` in linker flags.

## For FPU
1. FPU initialization
    ```C
    SCB->CPACR |= ((3 << 10*2)|(3 << 11*2));
    ```

2. Float ABI selection
    ```C
    -mfloat-abi=xxx
    // xxx = soft/softfp/hard
    ```
3. FPU selection
    ```C
    -mfpu=xxx
    // xxx = fpv4-sp-d16
    ```

4. Default all floating point constant in source to single precision floats
    ```C
    -fsingle-precision-constant
    ```

5. Warn about float to double promotion
    ```C
    -Wdouble-promotion
    ```

6. Use fast math 
    ```C
    -ffast-math
    ```

## AS5600 - Grove 12 bit Magnetic Rotary Position Sensor / Encoder
    4096 positions per round.
    The output is selectable, you can either use the I2C
    interface to output the RAW data or output
    the PWM wave/Analog wave via the OUT pin.
